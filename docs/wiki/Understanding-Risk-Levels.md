# Understanding Risk Levels

Altitude automatically classifies each banned product by risk level to help you prioritize your monitoring efforts.

## HIGH RISK 🔴

**Priority: Immediate Action**

- Deaths reported
- Serious injuries
- More than 10,000 units affected
- Hazards: fire, electrocution, choking, lead poisoning, strangulation

**Recommendation:** Set up daily investigations for HIGH-risk banned products.

## MEDIUM RISK 🟡

**Priority: Monitor Regularly**

- Minor injuries reported
- 1,000 - 10,000 units affected
- Hazards: cuts, burns, falls, tip-over

**Recommendation:** Weekly or biweekly investigations are usually sufficient.

## LOW RISK 🟢

**Priority: Periodic Checks**

- No injuries reported
- Fewer than 1,000 units affected
- Minor defects, labeling issues

**Recommendation:** Monthly investigations or manual searches when needed.

## How Risk Classification Works

The system automatically calculates risk levels based on:
- Number of deaths reported
- Number of injuries reported
- Number of units affected
- Type of hazards involved
- Severity of potential harm

This classification helps you:
- Prioritize your team's limited time on HIGH-risk banned products
- Allocate resources effectively across your banned product management program
- Generate risk-based reports for regulatory oversight
- Focus enforcement efforts where they matter most
