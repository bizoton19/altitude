# Listings

The Listings section allows you to view, manage, and add marketplace listings that may contain banned products.

## Adding Listings

You can add listings to Altitude in two ways: manually or through automated investigations. Manual addition is useful when you discover a listing during browsing or when someone reports a potential banned product.

## Reviewing Flagged Listings

When automated investigations find potential matches, listings are automatically flagged for review.

### Accessing Flagged Listings

2. **View Flagged Listings** - See all listings that were automatically flagged
   - Filter by risk level, marketplace, or date
   - Sort by priority or match confidence

### Review Workflow

1. **Review Listing Details** - Click on any listing to see full details
   - View original listing URL and images
   - See which banned product it matches
   - Review match confidence score

2. **Verify the Match** - Compare listing details with banned product information
   - Check product name, manufacturer, model numbers
   - Review images if available
   - Verify hazard matches

3. **Take Action:**
   - **If Match is Verified:** Mark as Verified Match, export for takedown, generate compliance report
   - **If Not a Match:** Mark as False Positive (system learns from this)
   - **If Needs More Review:** Add notes for later review

### Risk-Based Prioritization

Flagged listings are prioritized by risk level:
- **HIGH Risk** - Review immediately
- **MEDIUM Risk** - Review within 24-48 hours
- **LOW Risk** - Review as time permits

### Bulk Actions

2. Click **Export for Takedown**
3. Choose export format (CSV, JSON, or marketplace-specific format)
4. Download the file
5. Use marketplace contact information from Settings to send takedown requests
