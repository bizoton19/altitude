<h2>Risk Classification You Can Act On</h2>

**Altitude automatically classifies every banned product by risk level:**

### <span class="risk-badge risk-high">● HIGH RISK</span>
Banned products with deaths, serious injuries, or 10,000+ units affected. Hazards include fire, electrocution, choking, lead poisoning, strangulation. **Action:** Schedule daily investigations immediately.

### <span class="risk-badge risk-medium">● MEDIUM RISK</span>
Banned products with minor injuries or 1,000-10,000 units affected. Hazards include cuts, burns, falls, tip-over. **Action:** Weekly or biweekly investigations usually sufficient.

### <span class="risk-badge risk-low">● LOW RISK</span>
Banned products with no injuries and fewer than 1,000 units affected. Minor defects, labeling issues. **Action:** Monthly investigations or manual searches when needed.

**Risk classification helps you:**
- Prioritize your team's limited time on HIGH-risk banned products
- Allocate resources effectively across your banned product management program
- Generate risk-based reports for regulatory oversight
- Focus enforcement efforts where they matter most
